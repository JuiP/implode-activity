2007/08/09 - Version 1 released.

2007/11/19 - Version 2 released.

  - Icon modified to display in Mediawiki renderer correctly (works fine
    everywhere else).
  - Added a reward graphic when the level is successfully cleared.
  - Rewrote board data structure to one that should be more effective.
  - Improved level generator.  The old generator generated some unsolvable
    levels, and the rest were solvable in a certain way that makes the game
    easier once you know about it.  The new one should be more robust.
  - Implemented "new game" and "repeat game" functions.
  - Completed sliding animation.
  - Implemented undo/redo.
  - Added "sugarless" file for developing in a non-Sugar environment.
  - Ported sugarless code back to activity.
  - Added new, retry, undo, redo, easy, medium, and hard icons.

TODO: 
- Add a way to select difficulty.
- Gamepad/keyboard controls need to be added.
- Check for internationalizable text.
- Maybe include a way to regenerate earlier games or games from another
  laptop?
- The game could detect a loss and display a "Try again" graphic?
- The activity needs to save/restore the current game on exit/restart (maybe
  using the Journal?).
- Rectangle invalidation could be improved.
- A tutorial mode or sequence of introductory games might help.
- The code documentation and organization could be improved. Some
  calculations are repeated.
- Audio cues might be nice.
- Tracking win/loss statistics might be nice.
